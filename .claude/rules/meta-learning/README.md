# Meta-Learning Rules

This folder contains lean, evolving rules that Claude updates as decisions are made during development.

## Guidelines for Adding Rules

- **One rule per file**, named descriptively (e.g., `use-uuid-for-ids.md`)
- **1-2 lines max** per rule — keep it terse
- **Point to code** instead of explaining: reference files/folders as living documentation
- **Code is the documentation** — don't duplicate what the code already says
- **Add a rule when**: a decision is made, a pattern is established, or a mistake is corrected
- **Remove a rule when**: it no longer applies or the codebase has moved on
